## How to play:

- Use the arrow keys to move the snack to eat the blocks, increasing the size of the snake. The goal is to make the snake as long as possible.


## My goals for writing this game include:

- Practice writing true object-oriented programming in Python as opposed to simple top-to-bottom scripts.

- Learn more about how to work with ncurses in Python.
